' How to completely hide the dock panel's caption?
' 
' By setting the DockManager.DockingOptions.ShowCaptionOnMouseHover property it's
' possible to set whether the dock panel's caption is shown only when the mouse
' pointer hovers over the panel's top or all the time. This example demonstrates
' how to prevent the dock panel's caption from being shown for an individual dock
' panel all the time.
